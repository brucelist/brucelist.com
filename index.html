                                                        work with Mr Lotfi. We were first time buyers and were guided
                                                        the whole way through this crazy process with such care and
                                                        professionalism. As first time home buyers, we were very worried
                                                        of working with a real estate broker. However, after our first
                                                        experience with him, we felt completely comfortable. It left a
                                                        huge impression on us that he was willing to direct us away from
                                                        a purchase which would have been very easy for him to get, but
                                                        was not the right home for us. We appreciated the frankness with
                                                        which he pointed out the reasons not to buy and the
                                                        encouragement he gave us to wait for the right place.He was
                                                        patient, understanding, professional and kind. I would highly

                                                        house in Tuscany, Calgary, and the house was sold with a very
                                                        good price in a reasonable time, considering the Calgary market
                                                        these days. I really appreciate Bruce's hard work, he is
                                                        professional and genuinely nice person. The professional service
                                                        I received from Bruce that really helped selling the house
                                                        includes: - Good suggestions for some minor upgrades which
                                                        didn't cost me much, but had a huge impact, specially in first
                                                        impression. - Excellent market analysis and advice about the
                                                        good timing to be in market. - Realistic price evaluation - Good
                                                        knowledge of laws and regulations, - Excellent negotiation
                                                        skills in every aspect and different stage of the contract. -
                                                        Friendly and professional attitude. Without a doubt, Bruce will

                                    <p>Some agents are concerned only with generating new listings; they often assume
                                        their listing will sell eventually even if it takes several months and price
                                        reductions to do so.
                                        <br /><br />
                                        Be cautious of any agent who focuses on an inflated price evaluation of your
                                        property to win over your business.
